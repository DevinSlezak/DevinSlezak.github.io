        <h1 class="hed">About Me</h1>
        <p class="info">Overall, my career goals are extremely mixed and consist of many different possiblities. I definetely plan on going through college education and going through numerous types of majors. I plan on going through education relating to chemistry, math, and computer science since these are all topics that were enjoyable throughout high school. I plan on trying to reach all the prerequisites for admission into my preferred colleges by focusing on them throughout junior and senior year. I also know that I will have to study much harder than I previously done in other school years since these last 2 years are the deciding factors. Chemistry, math, and computer science are my main choices since they are all topics that in high school, I flourished through and/or I enjoyed them much more than I did with other classes such as english. </p>

        <p class="info">Considering all the careers I am planning on entering, I am able to understand everything that is taught to me easily. If a lesson is taught in the proper manner, I am fully capable of being able to learn and adapt to what is taught to me. Another characteristic that I noticed is prominent is that I am able to make changes fairly quickly if it is a critical and significant problem that I have had trouble with. Whenever I am learning, doing homework, or working in general, I mark my mistakes that were always present and I am able to learn from what is correct and make the necessary adjustments. Important achievments that I have accomplished revolve around extracurriculars that I have done, 2 being band and martial arts. In martial arts, I reached brown belt, the final color before black, twice. I was not able to complete the process until black belt because of personal matters, both being moving and school. In band, I switched between numerous instruments that were different in all ways, going from trumpet to drums (mostly the Tenor drums and Bass drums).</p>

        <p class="info">I learned that I am fully capable in achieving anything I can if I am able to put myself through enough training and if I am fully dedicated to it. I have noticed as well that I am able to learn anything if it is taught to me in a manner that is not complicated as well. I also am able to adapt to anything I would like to if I research on it and if there are demonstrations on the topic at hand.  </p>

        <p class="info"> Overall, I believe that my years of being a student have been extremely interesting and very distinct when compared with a normal student's life. My future is also one of the parts of my life that I still debate about and always make changes with everyday, making it one of the most significant parts of my life. Thank you, additionally, for reading through my backstory and I hope you enjoy the other parts of my website.
