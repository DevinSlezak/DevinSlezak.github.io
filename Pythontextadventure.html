        <h1 class="hed">Problems I Dealt with and My Solutions</h1>
        <p class="mid">As I progressed through the coding, I did encounter various problems that I was able to resolve. One of the difficulties I encountered was trying to progress the story into one that would lead to many different pathways that branch out and branch back in. I at times created close to 4 possible answers for the user to type in so that the story has more variety and give the user more of a choice. In order to counter this problem, I had to think ahead of how the story could branch out to different answers and then be able to bring back into the same storyline. Because of branching the story outwards, it led to creating more states and adding on more code, which was also a difficulty since I had to define a function for each of these possible answers. It was difficult to keep track of the choices I made throughout the story, so I used letters as a way to combat this problem in order to keep better track of how the answers progressed through the story. Another problem that I encountered was trying to end the story without the code reprinting, causing a glitch. In order to fix this, I had to use an input that did not actually accept an input from the user, instead of just printing the final statement.</p>
