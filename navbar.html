Palm Desert High School combined Shadow Hills High School and Cathedral City High School all had lessons with their own individual sections, which was really fun to see how the other schools played. This is my section, which were the tenor drums.</td>
                <td class="home">This picture was taken when I went to Coachella for the first time after my friend had called me the same day to tell me he had an extra ticket. This is on the 1st day which was a friday after school. It was one of the most memorable experiences I have ever had since it was my first time going, although it did take a great amount of energy.</td>
                <td class="home">This photo was taken after one of my good friends, Narda, had a birthday and decided to celebrate it at Boomers with her friends. It was fun since I knew a good portion of the people, so it was memorable as well. We raced with the go-karts and played minigolf and after went to go eat at a restaurant.</td>
